      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of refactoring the Webpack configuration to generate a single agent.js bundle into clear, actionable subtasks. Consider steps such as analyzing current entry points, consolidating imports, updating polyfills for IE11, modifying output and optimization settings, validating the build in IE11, updating documentation, and running regression tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant configuration changes, careful dependency management, and compatibility testing for a legacy browser (IE11), which increases both technical and testing complexity. Ensuring all modules and polyfills are included in the correct order, preventing code splitting, and validating in a legacy environment require deep understanding of both the build system and the application's runtime behavior. The task also impacts documentation and requires thorough regression testing, justifying a high complexity score and the need for multiple subtasks to manage risk and ensure quality."
