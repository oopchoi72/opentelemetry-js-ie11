# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Documentation and Examples
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation and examples for IE11 support
# Details:
1. Create detailed documentation for IE11 support
2. Document known limitations and workarounds
3. Create migration guides for existing applications
4. Provide examples of IE11 integration
5. Document performance optimization techniques
6. Create troubleshooting guides
7. Document browser compatibility matrix

Documentation should include:
- Installation and setup instructions
- API differences between IE11 and modern browsers
- Performance considerations
- Polyfill requirements
- Bundle size optimization
- Common issues and solutions

Example documentation structure:
```markdown
# OpenTelemetry JS IE11 Support

## Installation

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/ie11-support
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```javascript
// Import the IE11 compatible version
var opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/ie11-support');

// Initialize tracer
var provider = new opentelemetry.BasicTracerProvider();
opentelemetry.trace.setGlobalTracerProvider(provider);

var tracer = opentelemetry.trace.getTracer('example-app');

// Create spans
var span = tracer.startSpan('my-operation');
// ... perform operations ...
span.end();
```

### Known Limitations

- Performance overhead in IE11 is approximately 15-20% compared to modern browsers
- Some advanced features may have limited functionality
- Maximum recommended spans per page: 1000

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"Symbol is undefined"** - Ensure polyfills are loaded before OpenTelemetry
2. **Performance degradation** - Use the performance optimization guide
3. **"Object doesn't support property or method 'includes'"** - Check that Array polyfills are loaded
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify documentation accuracy with actual implementation
2. Test code examples in IE11 environment
3. Review documentation for completeness
4. Validate troubleshooting guides with common issues
5. Test migration guides with sample applications
6. Verify performance claims with benchmarks
7. Test documentation in different formats (web, PDF, IDE)
