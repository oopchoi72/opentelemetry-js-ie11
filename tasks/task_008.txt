# Task ID: 8
# Title: XMLHttpRequest 계측 구현
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create IE11 compatible instrumentation for XMLHttpRequest to replace fetch-based instrumentation
# Details:
This task has been completed as part of Task 6 "Adapt @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web for IE11".

The following components have been implemented:

1. **XMLHttpRequestInstrumentation** (in xmlhttprequest-transport.ts):
   - Complete XHR lifecycle instrumentation with timing measurement
   - Request/response header capture with CORS handling
   - Context propagation with W3C Trace Context support
   - Error handling and status code capture
   - Performance optimization with minimal overhead

2. **XMLHttpRequestTransport** (also in xmlhttprequest-transport.ts):
   - IE11-compatible transport layer for OpenTelemetry
   - Batch processing with retry logic
   - Proper error handling and timeout management
   - Content-Type and encoding support

3. **WebResourceTiming Integration**:
   - XHR request timing collection
   - Map polyfill for IE11 compatibility
   - Resource timing entry creation
   - Observer pattern for timing notifications

4. **Auto-Instrumentation Integration**:
   - Automatic XHR instrumentation initialization
   - Feature detection and graceful degradation
   - Configuration management and status tracking

All requirements from the original task description have been fulfilled, including:
- Dedicated XMLHttpRequest instrumentation module
- Request and response header capture
- Timing information for XHR lifecycle events
- Error information capture
- Context propagation for XHR requests
- Minimal performance impact
- Proper CORS and same-origin policy handling

# Test Strategy:
The following tests have been completed:

1. Tested instrumentation with various request types (GET, POST, etc.)
2. Verified header propagation works correctly
3. Tested timing accuracy for different network conditions
4. Verified error handling and status code capture
5. Tested with synchronous and asynchronous XHR requests
6. Benchmarked performance overhead
7. Tested with real-world APIs and services

All tests have passed, confirming the XMLHttpRequest instrumentation is fully functional and IE11-compatible.
