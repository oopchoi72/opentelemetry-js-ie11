# Task ID: 7
# Title: IE11용 @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics 지원 구현
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Adapt the metrics SDK to work in IE11 environment
# Details:
1. Fork or create a modified version of @opentelemetry/sdk-metrics
2. Convert ES6+ syntax to ES5 compatible code
3. Replace modern JavaScript features with polyfilled alternatives
4. Optimize metric collection for IE11 performance constraints
5. Ensure histogram calculation works efficiently in IE11
6. Adapt aggregation logic to handle IE11 limitations
7. Implement efficient metric export for IE11

Example histogram implementation optimization:
```javascript
// Optimize histogram calculation for IE11
function createHistogram(boundaries) {
  var counts = new Array(boundaries.length + 1);
  for (var i = 0; i < counts.length; i++) {
    counts[i] = 0;
  }
  
  return {
    record: function(value) {
      var bucketIndex = counts.length - 1;
      for (var i = 0; i < boundaries.length; i++) {
        if (value <= boundaries[i]) {
          bucketIndex = i;
          break;
        }
      }
      counts[bucketIndex]++;
    },
    getCounts: function() {
      return counts.slice();
    }
  };
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test all metric types (counter, gauge, histogram) in IE11
2. Verify metric collection under various load conditions
3. Test aggregation accuracy for different metric types
4. Benchmark performance against the 20% threshold requirement
5. Test memory usage patterns to prevent leaks
6. Verify metric export functionality
7. Compare metrics data between IE11 and modern browsers

# Subtasks:
## 1. ES6+ Syntax Conversion [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Convert all ES6+ syntax (e.g., arrow functions, let/const, classes, template literals) to ES5-compatible JavaScript to ensure IE11 compatibility.
### Details:
Optimization techniques: Use Babel or similar transpilers with IE11 target; minimize polyfill usage to only required features. Validation criteria: All code passes in IE11 without syntax errors; automated linting confirms no ES6+ syntax remains.
<info added on 2025-05-23T12:41:22.374Z>
ES6+ Syntax Conversion 완료:

✅ 완료 사항:
- 기본 metrics SDK 타입 정의 (src/sdk-metrics/types.ts)
- IE11 utility 함수들 (src/sdk-metrics/utils/ie11-utils.ts) 
  - Object.assign, Array.find/includes/fill 등 polyfill
  - 고해상도 타이밍, 안전한 JSON 처리
  - 메모리 효율적인 배치 처리
- Counter, Histogram, Gauge instrument 구현 (src/sdk-metrics/instruments/)
  - 모든 코드가 ES5 호환 (var, function, for loops)
  - IE11 메모리 제약 고려한 최적화
  - binary search, 효율적인 bucket 계산 등 포함

모든 코드는 ES5 문법만 사용하며 IE11에서 작동하도록 설계됨.

## 2. Modern JavaScript Feature Replacement [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Replace unsupported modern JavaScript features (e.g., Promises, Map/Set, Array methods like find, includes) with IE11-compatible alternatives or polyfills.
### Details:
Optimization techniques: Prefer native ES5 constructs over polyfills for performance; avoid large polyfill bundles. Validation criteria: All features function correctly in IE11; unit tests cover edge cases for replaced features.
<info added on 2025-05-23T12:43:57.742Z>
Modern JavaScript Feature Replacement completed:

✅ Completed items:
- Implemented metrics export system (src/sdk-metrics/export/metric-exporter.ts)
  - XMLHttpRequest primary, image beacon fallback
  - Exponential backoff retry logic
  - IE11 timeout handling and error management
- Implemented Aggregation engine (src/sdk-metrics/aggregators/aggregation-engine.ts)
  - Sum, Gauge, Histogram aggregators
  - Advanced calculation functions (percentile, average, std deviation)
  - Temporal aggregation support
  - All functionality IE11 compatible (assumes polyfill when Promise is used)

ES6+ features replaced with IE11 compatible alternatives:
- Promise → conditional polyfill usage
- Map/Set → regular objects and arrays
- Array.find/includes → custom polyfill
- Object.assign → custom polyfill
- fetch → XMLHttpRequest + image beacon

## 3. 메트릭 수집 최적화 [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Optimize the metric collection pipeline for IE11, focusing on minimizing DOM interactions and memory allocations.
### Details:
Optimization techniques: Batch metric updates, reuse objects, avoid closures where possible. Validation criteria: Collection pipeline processes metrics with minimal GC pressure and no memory leaks in IE11; performance benchmarks meet targets.

## 4. 히스토그램 계산 구현 [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement efficient histogram calculation logic compatible with IE11, ensuring accurate bucket assignment and aggregation.
### Details:
Optimization techniques: Use preallocated arrays for buckets, avoid dynamic property access. Validation criteria: Histogram calculations are accurate and performant in IE11; unit tests validate bucket boundaries and counts.

Memory Management and Performance:

✅ Implemented memory management features:
- Object pooling: Reuse of data points in Counter, Gauge, and Histogram
- Memory limitations: maxArrayLength and maxObjectKeys settings in IE11Features
- Garbage collection optimization: 
  - Minimized closures, used var declarations
  - Pre-allocated arrays (using arrayFill)
  - String concatenation optimization
- Resource cleanup: Reference release in shutdown method
- Batch processing: Metric collection processed in batches

✅ Performance optimizations:
- Binary search: O(log n) algorithm for finding Histogram buckets
- Caching: Property key normalization cache
- Lazy initialization: Objects created only when needed
- Timer optimization: setTimeout usage for IE11 compatibility
- Memory-efficient aggregation: Minimized temporary objects

All features designed with consideration for IE11 memory constraints.

### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Implement metric export mechanisms (e.g., XHR, image beacons) that work reliably in IE11, avoiding fetch and other unsupported APIs.
### Details:
Optimization techniques: Use XMLHttpRequest for async export; fallback to image beacons for fire-and-forget. Validation criteria: Metrics are exported successfully in IE11 under various network conditions; export failures are handled gracefully.
