# Task ID: 16
# Title: Fix Critical TypeScript Compilation Errors and Optimize Bundle Size
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve urgent TypeScript compilation errors in core modules and optimize the bundle size from 878KB to 174KB.
# Details:
This task requires addressing several critical TypeScript compilation issues:

1. Fix the `importScripts` type error in core/index.ts:
   - Identify why TypeScript is flagging importScripts (likely due to missing type definitions)
   - Add proper type declarations or use appropriate type assertions
   - Ensure compatibility with the polyfills implemented in Task 2

2. Improve type safety for hasOwnProperty usage:
   - Replace direct calls to obj.hasOwnProperty() with Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)
   - Add proper type guards where necessary
   - Consider creating a type-safe utility function for hasOwnProperty checks

3. Resolve interface conflicts in metrics/index.ts:
   - Identify and fix overlapping or contradictory interface definitions
   - Ensure proper extension of interfaces where needed
   - Consolidate duplicate interfaces

4. Optimize bundle size (878KB â†’ 174KB):
   - Implement tree-shaking optimizations
   - Remove unused imports and dead code
   - Configure TypeScript compiler options for optimal output
   - Consider code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate
   - Review and optimize third-party dependencies

This task builds upon the polyfills implemented in Task 2, ensuring that all TypeScript code properly interacts with those polyfills while maintaining type safety.

# Test Strategy:
To verify successful completion of this task:

1. TypeScript Compilation Testing:
   - Run `tsc --noEmit` to verify all TypeScript errors are resolved
   - Ensure zero TypeScript errors in CI/CD pipeline
   - Verify compilation works with strict type checking enabled

2. Runtime Testing:
   - Create unit tests for the fixed components in core/index.ts
   - Test edge cases for hasOwnProperty usage
   - Verify metrics functionality works as expected

3. Bundle Size Verification:
   - Use webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar tool to measure bundle size
   - Confirm reduction from 878KB to approximately 174KB
   - Document the optimization techniques that yielded the most significant reductions

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test in IE11 to ensure polyfill compatibility
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Ensure no regression in browser compatibility

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and document load time improvements
   - Verify that the optimizations don't negatively impact runtime performance
   - Create performance benchmarks for future reference
