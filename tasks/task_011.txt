# Task ID: 11
# Title: 성능 최적화 구현
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the library for IE11 performance constraints
# Details:
1. Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in IE11
2. Implement batching for trace and metric data
3. Optimize serialization and deserialization
4. Reduce memory allocations and garbage collection pressure
5. Implement throttling for high-frequency events
6. Create performance benchmarks to measure improvements
7. Optimize polyfill usage to minimize overhead

Example performance optimizations:
```javascript
// Optimize object creation with object pooling
function createObjectPool(factory, reset, initialSize) {
  var pool = [];
  
  // Pre-allocate objects
  for (var i = 0; i < initialSize; i++) {
    pool.push(factory());
  }
  
  return {
    acquire: function() {
      if (pool.length > 0) {
        return pool.pop();
      }
      return factory();
    },
    release: function(obj) {
      reset(obj);
      pool.push(obj);
    }
  };
}

// Example usage for span data
var spanDataPool = createObjectPool(
  function() { return { attributes: {}, startTime: 0, endTime: 0 }; },
  function(obj) { 
    obj.attributes = {}; 
    obj.startTime = 0; 
    obj.endTime = 0; 
  },
  100
);

// Throttle function for high-frequency events
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  var lastCall = 0;
  return function() {
    var now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
      lastCall = now;
      return fn.apply(this, arguments);
    }
  };
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create performance benchmarks comparing IE11 vs modern browsers
2. Measure CPU usage during heavy instrumentation
3. Test memory consumption patterns
4. Verify performance under various load conditions
5. Test with real-world applications to measure overhead
6. Verify the 20% performance threshold is maintained
7. Test throttling effectiveness for high-frequency events

# Subtasks:
## 1. 병목 지점 식별 [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify performance bottlenecks in IE11 rendering and JavaScript execution
### Details:
Use browser developer tools to profile performance in IE11, focusing on render times that are 100-1000x slower than in Chrome/Firefox. Analyze DOM manipulation patterns, deeply nested elements, and table height percentage specifications that may cause slowdowns. Document all identified bottlenecks with metrics.

## 2. 데이터 배치 처리 구현 [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement batching for DOM updates and data operations
### Details:
Refactor code to batch DOM changes using DocumentFragment for HTML additions. Group multiple updates together to reduce browser reflow/repaint cycles. Implement data operation batching to minimize processing overhead. Measure performance improvements against baseline metrics.

## 3. 직렬화 최적화 [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Optimize data serialization and parsing processes
### Details:
Review and optimize JSON parsing/stringifying operations. Implement custom serialization for frequently used data structures. Consider binary formats for large datasets. Measure serialization time improvements and memory usage reductions.

## 4. 메모리 할당 감소 [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Reduce memory allocation and garbage collection impact
### Details:
Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects. Optimize DOM structure by simplifying HTML and reducing nesting depth. Avoid closures that retain large scopes. Monitor memory usage patterns and garbage collection frequency in IE11.

## 5. 이벤트 스로틀링 구현 [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement throttling and debouncing for event handlers
### Details:
Add throttling to scroll, resize, and input events. Implement debouncing for search and other user input processing. Optimize event delegation patterns to reduce handler count. Measure event processing time and UI responsiveness improvements.

## 6. 벤치마크 생성 [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Create comprehensive benchmarks for performance testing
### Details:
Develop automated benchmarks that measure rendering time, JavaScript execution, memory usage, and UI responsiveness in IE11. Create test cases that specifically target identified bottlenecks. Implement continuous performance monitoring to prevent regressions.

## 7. 폴리필 최적화 [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.6
### Description: Optimize or replace inefficient polyfills for IE11
### Details:
Identify performance-critical polyfills used for IE11 compatibility. Replace generic polyfills with IE11-specific optimized versions. Consider removing unnecessary polyfills based on feature requirements. Measure performance impact of each polyfill optimization.
