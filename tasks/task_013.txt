   - **Custom Launchers**: IE11_local, bs_ie11_win10, bs_ie11_win8_1, bs_ie11_win7
   - **Babel Preprocessing**: ES5 transpilation for IE11 compatibility
   - **Test Reporting**: JUnit, coverage, spec reporters with detailed output
   - **BrowserStack Integration**: Automated cloud testing with proper configuration
   - **Environment Detection**: CI/development mode switching
   - **Timeout Management**: Extended timeouts for IE11 compatibility

2. **IE11 Polyfills** (test/polyfills/ie11-polyfills.js):
   - **Core JavaScript APIs**: Object.assign, Object.keys, Object.values, Object.entries
   - **Array Methods**: find, findIndex, includes, from
   - **String Methods**: startsWith, endsWith, includes, repeat
   - **ES6 Features**: Promise, Map, Set with full API compatibility
   - **DOM APIs**: CustomEvent, Element.closest, Element.matches, classList
   - **Performance APIs**: performance.now, requestAnimationFrame
   - **Event Handling**: addEventListener polyfill for IE8 compatibility

3. **IE11 Test Utilities** (test/utils/ie11-test-utils.js):
   - **Browser Detection**: IE11 feature detection and capability checking
   - **Mock Objects**: XMLHttpRequest, fetch, performance, localStorage mocks
   - **Test Helpers**: Span creation, attribute validation, DOM manipulation
   - **Async Utilities**: waitFor, timing measurement, network simulation
   - **Event Simulation**: User interaction simulation with IE11 compatibility
   - **Assertion Library**: Custom assertion helpers for IE11 testing
   - **Memory Tracking**: Performance monitoring and cleanup utilities

4. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (.github/workflows/ie11-tests.yml):
   - **Multi-Job Pipeline**: Build, local testing, BrowserStack testing, benchmarking
   - **Matrix Testing**: Windows 10, 8.1, 7 with IE11
   - **BrowserStack Integration**: Automated cloud testing with proper session management
   - **Performance Benchmarking**: IE11-specific performance measurement
   - **Bundle Analysis**: Size monitoring and PR comments
   - **Test Reporting**: Comprehensive result aggregation and artifact management
   - **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup and session termination

5. **Package.json Scripts**:
   - **test:ie11:local**: Local IE11 testing
   - **test:ie11:browserstack**: BrowserStack cloud testing
   - **test:ie11:dev**: Development mode with auto-watch
   - **test:ie11:headless**: Headless testing for CI
   - **benchmark:ie11**: Performance benchmarking
   - **analyze:ie11**: Bundle size analysis
   - **build:ie11**: IE11-specific build process

6. **DevDependencies Added**:
   - **karma-babel-preprocessor**: ES5 transpilation
   - **karma-browserstack-launcher**: BrowserStack integration
   - **karma-coverage**: Code coverage reporting
   - **karma-junit-reporter**: CI-friendly test reporting
   - **karma-spec-reporter**: Detailed test output

7. **Testing Features**:
   - **Cross-Platform**: Windows 7, 8.1, 10 with IE11
   - **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing on push/PR
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Bundle size and execution time tracking
   - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting
   - **Artifact Management**: Test results, coverage, and analysis preservation

# Test Strategy:
✅ COMPLETED: The following test strategy has been implemented:

1. Verified tests run successfully in IE11 environment (local and BrowserStack)
2. Tested the CI/CD pipeline with sample commits through GitHub Actions
3. Verified test reporting works correctly with JUnit, coverage, and spec reporters
4. Tested with different Windows versions (7, 8.1, 10) using matrix testing
5. Validated performance benchmarking accuracy with IE11-specific measurements
6. Tested browser disconnection and reconnection handling with extended timeouts
7. Verified test coverage reporting and artifact preservation
8. Implemented cross-platform compatibility testing
9. Added bundle size analysis and monitoring
10. Configured comprehensive error capture and reporting
