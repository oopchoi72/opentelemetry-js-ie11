# Task ID: 5
# Title: IE11용 @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base 변환
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Adapt the base tracing SDK to work in IE11 environment
# Details:
1. Fork or create a modified version of @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base
2. Convert all ES6+ syntax to ES5 compatible code
3. Replace modern JavaScript features with polyfilled alternatives:
   - Replace Map/Set with polyfilled versions
   - Convert async/await to Promise chains
   - Replace array spread/rest with apply/concat
4. Optimize the sampling and context propagation for IE11 performance
5. Ensure span creation and management works efficiently in IE11
6. Adapt batch processing to handle IE11 performance constraints

Example async code transformation:
```javascript
// Original async/await code
async function exportSpans(spans) {
  try {
    await exporter.export(spans);
    return { code: ExportResultCode.SUCCESS };
  } catch (error) {
    return { code: ExportResultCode.FAILED, error };
  }
}

// Transformed Promise-based code
function exportSpans(spans) {
  return exporter.export(spans).then(function() {
    return { code: ExportResultCode.SUCCESS };
  }).catch(function(error) {
    return { code: ExportResultCode.FAILED, error: error };
  });
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create comprehensive tests for span creation, modification, and ending
2. Test context propagation across different execution contexts
3. Verify sampling behavior works correctly
4. Test batch span processing under load
5. Benchmark performance against modern browsers to ensure it meets the 20% threshold
6. Test memory usage patterns to prevent leaks in IE11

# Subtasks:
## 1. ES6+ Syntax Conversion [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Convert the SDK to use modern ES6+ syntax for better compatibility and readability.
### Details:
Replace CommonJS with ES modules, update syntax for arrow functions, and use async/await for promises.
<info added on 2025-05-23T02:32:34.193Z>
ISSUE IDENTIFIED: The current subtask description is incorrect - it mentions "modern ES6+ syntax" when we need IE11 compatibility (ES5).

CORRECTED APPROACH:
1. Convert ES6+ syntax TO ES5 syntax (not the other way around)
2. Replace ES modules WITH CommonJS or simple variable exports
3. Convert arrow functions TO function expressions
4. Replace async/await WITH Promise chains
5. Convert const/let TO var declarations
6. Replace template literals WITH string concatenation

PLAN:
1. Create sdk-trace-base directory structure
2. Start with basic Span class implementation
3. Convert all ES6+ features to IE11-compatible ES5
4. Focus on core span lifecycle: creation, attributes, events, ending
5. Implement context propagation mechanism
6. Add sampling logic

## 2. Modern JavaScript Feature Replacement [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Replace outdated JavaScript features with modern equivalents to improve performance and maintainability.
### Details:
Update deprecated methods and use modern JavaScript features like `for...of` loops and `Object.assign()`.
<info added on 2025-05-23T02:40:16.883Z>
Identify and replace modern JavaScript features with IE11-compatible alternatives:

1. Replace Array methods:
   - Convert Array.find() to traditional loops with conditional checks
   - Replace Array.includes() with indexOf() > -1 checks
   - Convert Array.entries() to manual index/value tracking

2. Replace Object.assign() with manual property copying:
   ```
   // Instead of Object.assign(target, source)
   for (var key in source) {
     if (source.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
       target[key] = source[key];
     }
   }
   ```

3. Convert for...of loops to traditional for loops or forEach

4. Replace destructuring with explicit variable assignments:
   ```
   // Instead of const { a, b } = obj;
   var a = obj.a;
   var b = obj.b;
   ```

5. Ensure Promise usage is compatible with polyfills

6. Replace modern string methods:
   - startsWith/endsWith with indexOf checks
   - padStart/padEnd with custom implementations

Create utility functions for these replacements to maintain code readability while ensuring IE11 compatibility.
